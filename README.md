A directory bruteforce tool. Requires Python 3
 - k-ddev

Planned functionalities for future:
    scanning optimizations, maybe hotkeys to control flow,
    maybe scraping for subpage URIs, session pause/save/resume,
    maybe others...

Some websites don't like being scanned like this, and since this tool can also make as many requests at once
as you want it to, it could also be used as a DOS if you really wanted to use it that way, so if you get in
trouble with a scanned site / the man / your internet service provider, I don't care. Your problem.
