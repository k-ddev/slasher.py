A directory bruteforce tool. Requires Python 3

If you don't like the "header" that prints when the program is run, you can disable it with ctrl+f "if 1:" and toggling the 1 to 0. 

Some websites don't like being scanned like this, and since this tool can also make as many requests at once as you want it to, it could also be used as a DOS if you really wanted to use it that way, so anything bad that happens to you as a result of running this is your fault.
